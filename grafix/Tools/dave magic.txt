How to use Dave's magic graphics flipper:

1. Download Python 2.6 or 7
2. Download the Python Imaging Library (PIL) for whichever version you have
3. from terminal or python command line cd into directory with imgFlip.py
4. type "python imgFlip.py" (no quotes)
5. It will ask for the folder. This will loop through all folders inside the specified folder, so be careful.
	Starting folder is the current directory, so if run from grafix you could type "garf"
6. Type the file type
7. Enter the text to append to the name. It will add this to the original name, so for instance if you make an "anubis.png"
	You can add ".r" and it will output an anubis.r.png.
8. eat dicks
